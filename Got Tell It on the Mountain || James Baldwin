‘But there’s lots of good in Frank. I just got to be patient and he’ll come along all right.’ To ‘come along’ meant that he would change his ways and consent to be the husband she had travelled so far to find.

For ten years he came along, but when he left her he was the same man she had married. He had not changed at all.
